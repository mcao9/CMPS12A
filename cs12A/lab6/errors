There are a total of 5 errors.

First Error:
There is a typo when the sentence code 4, is inputted. The output is books
which is plural but should be singular.
Second Error:
The modifier code 4 with the corresponding sentence code 2, has the wrong output.
The specifications state that the output should be "cold", but the output is
"hot".
Third Error:
The modifier code 3 with the corresponding sentence code 3, has the wrong output.
The specifications state that the output should be "next weekend", but the 
output is "last weekend".
Fourth Error:
When the sentence code 5 is inputted with a modifier code that is out of bounds,
the program does print error in place for the word as expected. However,
when the word "ERROR" is printed, the rest of the sentence "you sent" is
not printed which should not be the case. The expected output of a out
of bounds input should be "Thanks for the ERROR you sent."
Fifth Error:
When a sentence code that is out of bounds is inputted, the expected output
is "# is not a valid sentence code". However, the output of this program is
missing the "not" and instead prints out "# is a valid sentence code".
